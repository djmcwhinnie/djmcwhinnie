# Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub ReadMe file, a place to find a quick summary about me and what kind of development work I'm currently looking into.

I've been working full-time as a web developer for over 3 years since completing a masters degree in mobile web development, but been involved with web development and design for much (much) longer.

Flash was still a thing, external stylesheets were the new thing and Macromedia Dreamweaver was a thing (No Adobe yet). My origin story includes some time working as a designer in print studios - skills and insights that are still invaluable to me today as a front-end developer.

I keep my passion for design alive with an interest in UX/UI, treating it as a bridge connecting to front-end development.

## 👨‍💻 I’m currently working on

- Getting a re-design of my personal site finished and online!
- Couple of side projects to push my JavaScript learning.
- Updating all of my developer content and spaces to try and engage with the community more.

## 🎓 I’m currently learning

- JavaScript and some of its frameworks and flavours e.g. React, ES6.
- UX/UI
- Managing Agile/Scrum environments and teams.
